            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ACcording to my ingagements, and promi≈øe to you la≈øt in <hi>London,</hi> I have ≈øent you the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt Occurrences and mo≈øt Remarkeable pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øages that hath happened in the North, ≈øince my comeing thither, which was upon Fryday, <hi>Iune</hi> 24. whereof, I ≈øhall impart to you, nothing but what I have had from good Information and intelligence; And likewi≈øe what J was an eye witne≈ø≈øe of.</p>
            <p>Upon SATTERDAY, <hi>Iune</hi> 25. I did accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate one Captaine For≈øter a Scotch-man (with whom I was very conver≈øant) in one dayes Iourny to Hull, who was to ≈øee ≈øome goods and other Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes (which he brought out of the we≈øt Indies to London, and from thence was tran≈øported by

Shipping to Hull) to be Conveyed to <hi>Yorke:</hi> But when we came at the gates of <hi>Hull,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Meldrone,</hi> and <hi>Captaine Moyer,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Hercules, one of the Shipps which rides before <hi>Hull,</hi> and now in the Kings ≈øervice, examined us, but would not give us admittance into the Towne; Whereupon we walked about the Walls to veiw the ≈øcituation thereof, which was all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and courti≈øie we received; And when we came to the Harbour, upon the north ≈øide of the Towne, where all their Shipping lyes, there was above 200. Souldiers at worke, ca≈øting up of Earth, and make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Batteries on both ≈øides the Harboure; Upon which was placed 4 peeces of Ordinance, for the defence of the Towne, we makeing ≈øome ≈ømall ≈øtay before that place, one Serjeant Major <hi>Gifford,</hi> with 20.

            <p>Upon Saterday, <hi>Iune</hi> 25. we mett a Po≈øt within two Miles of <hi>Hull,</hi> with 3 Proclamations from the King, to be Proclaimed at the Gates of <hi>Hull;</hi> But he was oppo≈øed by Sir <hi>Iohn Hotham,</hi> and not ≈øuffered to publi≈øh them, whereupon the Me≈ø≈øenger left them at the Gattes of Hull, and ≈øo departed.</p>
            <p>Munday, the 27. of Iune, we returned againe to <hi>YORKE,</hi> and that Morning the Lord Marque≈ø≈øe <hi>Hamilton</hi> tooke his Journey towards <hi>Scotland;</hi> The ≈øame day was a Ie≈øuite executed, and his Quarters ≈øet upon the Gattes of the City; This day al≈øo was a great combu≈øtion at the Court Gate, betwixt 5. Souldiers, and 2. Cavalyers, in which one of the Souldiers had his hand cut off, and yet the≈øe Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers e≈øcaped without any interruption.</p>
